# Superstore Sales Analysis and Forecasting

This repository contains a Power BI project that showcases sales insights and forecasting. The project includes a dashboard that offers a comprehensive overview of sales data, as well as a separate page dedicated to a sales forecasting model for the next 10 days. This README guide will walk you through the project.

## Introduction

The Superstore Sales Insights & Forecasting aims to help users gain valuable insights from sales data and facilitate informed decision-making. The project comprises two main components:

1. **Dashboard**: This component presents visual representations of historical sales data, enabling users to analyze trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

2. **Sales Forecasting**: The forecasting page utilizes advanced analytics to predict sales for the upcoming 10 days based on historical data. This predictive model empowers users to anticipate potential future sales trends.

The dashboard section offers an array of visualizations that empower users to explore and understand historical sales data. Key features of the dashboard include:

- Visualization of monthly and yearly sales trends.
- Comparison of sales across different categories and sub-categories.
- Geographical distribution of sales.
- Identification of top payment modes, segments, ship modes, and much more.
